 <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Kimi No Nawa</h3>
 <p>I like this movies a lot it was my first anime movie and i was really impressed with the story. it will be sin if i dont talk about the animation. It is drop dead gorgeous.</p>
 <h3>ETernal Sunshine of Spotless Mind</h3>
 <p>There is nothing much to talk about this movie because i cant describe how good it is to me. In the hole movie it was a rollercoster ride of emotion for me.</p>
 <h3>Dragon Ball Super Broly</h3>
 <p>i have to be biased about this movie a bit because dragon ball was my childhood. i got to watch my favourite charatcers of this show fight with each other with beautiful animation and the fight it was marvelous. I was glued to  the bench the whole time. </p>
